            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Students may struggle to stay motivated or connect with the material.</p>
            <p><strong>UDL Solution:</strong> Provide multiple ways to engage students, such as offering choices in assignments, incorporating hands-on activities, or connecting the material to students' interests.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Students may have trouble understanding the content due to different learning preferences or abilities.</p>
            <p><strong>UDL Solution:</strong> Use multiple means of representation, such as videos, infographics, and hands-on demonstrations, to make content more accessible to all learners.</p>

            <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Some students may not perform well on traditional assessments, such as written tests, which limits their ability to demonstrate their knowledge.</p>
            <p><strong>UDL Solution:</strong> Offer multiple means of action and expression, such as allowing students to create videos, presentations, or artwork to demonstrate what they have learned.</p>
