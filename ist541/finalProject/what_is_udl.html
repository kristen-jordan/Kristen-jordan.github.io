	<li><strong>Representation:</strong> Learners differ in how they perceive and understand information. The Representation principle emphasizes providing different ways of presenting content, such as using videos, infographics, text, and audio. This variety helps make content accessible and easier to understand for all learners.
	</li>

	<li><strong>Action and Expression:</strong> Learners also vary in how they express their knowledge. This principle encourages offering multiple means for learners to demonstrate their learning, whether through writing, speaking, drawing, or using multimedia. Giving students choices on how they show what they've learned allows them to use their strengths.
